> Developers could explore the districts of namespaces, walk around the garden of classes, then climbing up on virtual staircases in the middle of methods to look upon the city of source code and to see the software as never before.

Software visualization techniques and tools play an important role in the system comprehension efforts of software developers in the era of increasing code size and complexity. They enable the developer to have a global perception on various software attributes with the aid of different visualization metaphors. One of these visualization tools is CodeMetropolis which is built on top of the game engine Minecraft and which uses the city metaphor to show the structure of the source code as a virtual city. In it, different physical properties of the city and the buildings are related to various code metrics.

**The current stable and other binary packages are always avaible at [releases section](https://github.com/codemetropolis/CodeMetropolis/releases) on GitHub.**
