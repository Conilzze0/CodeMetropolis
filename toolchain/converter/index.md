This application is used to process the graph file generated by [SourceMeter][sm]t, which creates properties for each item, for exmaple functions that will be processed later by the Mapping Tool. 

**Usage**: `java -jar converter.jar -i <graph file> -o [<output.xml>]`

* `-i`: input, the path of the input graph file. Required. 
* `-o`: output, the path of the output XML file. Optional. 

**About the output XML**
