**Usage**: java –jar placing.jar –i `inputFile` [-o `outputFile`] [-m]  

**Command line options:**  

* -h: help, shows basic info.  
* -i: input, input from this file. Exactly this is the path of the input XML file, which is generated by the Mapping Tool. Required.  
* -o: output, output to this file. Output will be generated to the given path. Default: “placingToRendering.xml”. Optional.  
* -l: layout, layout algorithm. Layout can be PACK or TETRIS. Optional. Default value is PACK.   
* -m: map, whether or not the map should be shown.  

If we use the –m option, the following popup window will appear:   

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/placing_map_example.png"/>

On the map we can see the structure of the virtual city generated from the source code. After closing this window, the command will be finished.
